## Omnifood Landing Page

[https://omnifood.aniqa.dev/](https://omnifood.aniqa.dev/)

ðŸ¥— A full redesign of the original Omnifood website (fictional AI-based meal subscription service). Website utilizes a sticky navigation, hamburger menu, toggle switch, animations triggered by IntersectionObserver, and smooth scrolling.

## Tech
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Key Features

**Design**

- Converted the original websiteâ€™s assets to my chosen color scheme and style
- Fully responsive on all devices

**General**

- Hamburger menu that appears on tablet-sized screens or smaller
- Smooth scrolling active whenever any navigation links are clicked
- Subtle animations that trigger when a certain viewport rule is met (using `IntersectionObserver`)
- Added cross-browser support for certain CSS styles using prefixes (`-webkit`, `-moz-`, `-o-`, `-ms-`)
- Performed testing on different browsers and designs and had to update styling for the `select` input as the browser default styling differs from browser to browser
- Functional form with validation and a message displayed after submission by user
- Toggle between two different pricing models (monthly or annually)
- Marquee animation using `@keyframes` animation
